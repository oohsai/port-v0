# Getting Started with React Hooks

React Hooks **revolutionized** how developers write React applications by introducing a way to use state and other React features **without writing class components**. Since their introduction in React 16.8, hooks have become the standard approach for building modern React applications.

## Understanding `useState`

The `useState` hook is the foundation of state management in functional components. It allows you to add **state variables** to your components in a simple and intuitive way. When you call `useState`, it returns an array with two elements:

1. The **current state value**
2. A **function to update** it

This pattern eliminates the complexity of `this` binding in class components.

**Example: Counter Component**

```jsx
import { useState } from "react";

export default function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
